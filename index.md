# About me

Hello, my name is Ryan Bills and I have been studying computer science while working as a data engineer over the last four years. I am planning to continue my growth in my area of expertise, which includes ETL, data warehousing, and analytical applications. 

Throughout the computer science program at SNHU, I worked on many projects that provided me with skills that are transferrable to my work as a data engineer. While working through course projects, I learned how to collaborate with other developers while working on the same code simultaneously by utilizing git repositories and advanced git practices. I've also worked through the entire SDLC, through requirements gathering, development, testing, and implementation for data-centric projects involving data cleaning and analysis. While working in an Agile development environment as a data engineer, I was able to apply certain Agile concepts learned through coursework at SNHU to help my team and I better follow best practices such as writing out more defined and descriptive acceptance criteria in user stories and providing iterative value to stakeholders and end-users.

## Capstone Project
For my capstone project at SNHU, I decided to create a data pipeline for retrieving data from eBay's API and creating a report based off of the data. 
As a part of this project, some existing code for connecting to and manipulating a MongoDB database was reused from a prior project. The enhancements and new code exemplifies my skills in three categories: software engineering, databases, and data structures. Below are the artifacts showcased and described in detail.
